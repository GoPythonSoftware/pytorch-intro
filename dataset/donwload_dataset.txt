# If you haven't already, you need to install the Kaggle API client on your system.
# pip install kaggle
# You need to have a Kaggle account and an API key. If you haven't created an API key, you can do so by following these steps:
# Log in to your Kaggle account.
# Go to your account settings: https://www.kaggle.com/account
# Scroll down to the "API" section and click "Create New API Token." This will download a JSON file containing your API key.
# Place the downloaded JSON file (kaggle.json) in a directory called .kaggle located in your user's home directory. 
# Now, you can use the Kaggle API to download the dataset directly from the command line. Open your terminal and run the following command:
# kaggle datasets download -d paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
# this command will download the zip file, extract with: unzip chest-xray-pneumonia.zip
